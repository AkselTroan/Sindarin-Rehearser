# Sindarin-Rehearser
Python script that makes it easier to practice your sindarin. There are currently two gamemodes implemented: Glossary and Sentences. Planning on implementing conversation mode.
Here you will have a conversasion with the script and hopefully prepare you for speaking with someone else in Sindarin.

> **_NOTE:_**  The script is currently sensitive for spaces and such. Will be fixed in furture patch.

# Glossary
Here you can practice sindarin words. The script will give you a word and it is your task to translate. You can translate from Sindarin to English or English to Sindarin.


# Sentences
The script will give you a sentence and you need to translate the sentence. You can translate from Sindarin to English or English to Sindarin.

# Installation
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AkselTroan/Sindarin-Rehearser.git
```

Run the script and follow the menu
```
python sindarin.py
```

# Adding more word and sentences
The scripts works in a way that allows scaling. All you have to do is add words or sentences to the appropriate .txt file. Seperate the Sindarin word and the English with a ":"
Feel free to add more words and sentences in this repository
